This project is a mobile application that detects environmental noise levels in decibels (dB) and classifies them into different categories such as Silent, Normal, Loud, or Hazardous based on predefined thresholds. The app utilizes the device's microphone to capture real-time audio data, processes it to calculate the noise level, and provides instant feedback to the user. It also logs noise readings over time for analysis and visualization. This project is particularly useful for monitoring noise pollution, ensuring workplace safety, and raising awareness about harmful sound exposure.
